1. Deleting more parts with different area do not mean more inaccurate (one set of stimuli body vs. 3 legs)
2. Deleting more parts with the same area do not mean more inaccurate (3 legs vs. two ears)
3. Density of parts is the thing human clearly cares about (square pixel at denser area vs. square pixel at less dense area)
This somehows supports Biederman's theory.

2. 1107 + 1439 + 1171 vs 1099 + 2511
3. 1144, 2760
